# dynamic-fixtures

Sample project to demonstrate how to generate random fixtures with [Cypress](https://cypress.io).

## Pre-requirements

You need to have nodejs and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v14.17.0` and `6.14.13` of nodejs and npm respectively, and I suggest that you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode.

Run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
